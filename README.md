## sasm
**S**imple **As**e**m**bler

Uses a mnemonic definition file and a text assembler program to create a rom file,
which can be loaded into [Logisim](logisim.altervista.org/).

Usage:
```
-h print this help screen
-m [path to mnemonic definitions]
-i [path to assembler file]
-o [path to output binary file]
-p print out loaded mnemonics
-d enable debug log
```
See test.txt for an example mnemonic definition, test.asm for an example program and test.rom1 for the resulting rom file.
